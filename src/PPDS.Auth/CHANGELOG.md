## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Cross-tenant token cache issue** - Fixed bug where `ppds env list` would return environments from wrong tenant when user had profiles for multiple tenants. Root cause was MSAL account lookup using `FirstOrDefault()` instead of filtering by tenant. Now uses `HomeAccountId` for precise account lookup with tenant filtering fallback. ([#59](https://github.com/joshsmithxrm/ppds-sdk/issues/59))

### Added

- `HomeAccountId` property on `AuthProfile` and `ICredentialProvider` to track MSAL account identity across sessions
